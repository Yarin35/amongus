# amongus

Here you can find a little "virus" I made for fun.

It's using CSFML which isn't the most comon graphic lib but still works pretty well. There is no goal here you just spawn some little characters from 
among us to run all over your screen (1920 * 1080).

USAGE:

-do a "make re" to compile everything

-do a ./runner [number] where number is the number of little characters you want. 

⚠️⚠️⚠️ thoses little characters are really greedy since the each have their own window so don't go too crazy and start with a little number
(above 5 is already hard for little pc). You may freeze your screen and overuse you CPU/GPU (i have a friend whose pc's security litteraly killed the program 
because it was taking too much ressources lmao).
